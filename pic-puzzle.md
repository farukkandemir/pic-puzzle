# 🧩 PicPuzzle – MVP Plan

## 📌 Description  
**PicPuzzle** is a fun and interactive web-based sliding puzzle game where users upload images, turn them into puzzles, and challenge themselves or friends. The app provides a simple yet addictive way to test problem-solving skills with custom or AI-enhanced puzzles.

## 🎯 Core Features (Minimal but Engaging)  
1. **Upload an Image** – Users can upload a photo or choose from a preset gallery.  
2. **Puzzle Generation** – The app automatically divides the image into a **3x3 sliding puzzle**.  
3. **Play Mode** – Users slide tiles to rearrange the image correctly.  
4. **Win Detection** – The app detects when the puzzle is solved and displays a success message.  
5. **Basic AI Enhancements (Optional for MVP)** – AI can apply filters or distortions to increase difficulty.  
6. **Simple UI** – Clean, minimal interface for smooth gameplay.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP)  
- **More Grid Sizes** – Support for 4x4, 5x5, and custom grid sizes.  
- **Leaderboard & Timed Challenges** – Users can compete for the best completion time.  
- **Multiplayer Mode** – Send puzzle challenges to friends.  
- **AI-Generated Puzzle Modifications** – Random distortions or missing pieces for extra difficulty.  
- **User Accounts & Progress Tracking** – Save completed puzzles and track improvements.  

## 💰 Monetization Potential  
- **Premium Features** – Unlock harder puzzles, AI distortions, or custom grid sizes.  
- **Ad-Supported Free Tier** – Light banner ads or rewarded ads for extra features.  
- **Community Challenges** – Charge for hosting or premium leaderboard placements.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Suggested)  
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js (if needed for saving puzzles)  
- **Image Processing:** Canvas API or Three.js for rendering  
- **Deployment:** Vercel for fast hosting  

## 📣 Marketing & Growth  
- **Social Sharing** – Users can share solved puzzles and challenge friends.  
- **Reddit & Twitter Engagement** – Post in puzzle or gaming communities.  
- **SEO-Optimized Landing Page** – Target keywords like “online sliding puzzle” for organic traffic.  
- **Discord & Niche Forums** – Share in game dev and puzzle communities for early traction.
